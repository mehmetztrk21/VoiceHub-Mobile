# VoiceHub-Mobile

The current social media applications mostly focus on text, images, and videos, and the limited use of sound points to a communication problem. In this context, users can only express themselves with written or visual expressions, which may be inadequate in some cases. Therefore, voice-based social media applications can provide users with a different communication experience, offering a more authentic and personal expression opportunity. In this regard, the VoiceHub project aims to provide a solution for voice-based socialization platforms, increasing the use of sound in social media sharing, and aiming to provide a richer and deeper communication experience.

This thesis focuses solely on VoiceHub, a social media application based on voice sharing. VoiceHub is a platform where users can socialize and interact with each other using only their voices. The application's aim is to demonstrate how sound can be used differently in social media experiences by focusing on voice sharing.

Node.js, a JavaScript-based platform, was used as the backend software for the VoiceHub project. Node.js is an ideal choice for developing scalable, high-performance, fast, and efficient applications.

MongoDB, a document-based, NoSQL database, was used as the database for the VoiceHub project.

React Native was used for mobile application development for the VoiceHub project. React Native is a JavaScript-based framework used to develop native mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms.

JSON Web Token (JWT) was used for application security. JWT ensures the application's security and protects users' account security.

At the end of the project, a mobile application called VoiceHub was created, which allows users to socialize by sharing only their voices, contributing to their recognizability through their voices. In the future, the project is planned to be turned into a platform where people can earn money with their voices, providing a platform where people can socialize and earn at the same time.
